For PCA, use: ```decomposition.PCA```. To compute the first few eigenvectors of the random walk Laplacian, it is more efficient (and stable) to compute the first few eigenvectors of the normalized Laplacian via eigsh (because it is nicely symmetric), and then use $\\mathbf{u}_{rw}=\\mathbf{D}^{-1/2}\\mathbf{u}_n$.\n",
